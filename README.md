# Real Estate Price Prediction and Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end real estate analytics platform designed to predict property prices and provide recommendations. It uses machine learning algorithms to deliver accurate price predictions and leverages AWS for deployment, ensuring scalability and reliability. The platform includes interactive visualizations and a recommendation system to enhance user experience.

## Features
- **Price Prediction**: Predict property prices using a Random Forest Regressor model with a 90% R² score.
- **Data Visualizations**: Interactive visualizations such as geo maps, amenities word clouds, and scatter plots.
- **Recommendation System**: Suggests similar societies based on user preferences using cosine similarity.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Hosted on AWS for high availability and seamless performance.

## Repositories
